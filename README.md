This is a simple HTML code that creates a photo gallery using CSS Flexbox. The gallery displays multiple images in a responsive grid layout, making it easy to showcase a collection of photos.

Usage

Create an HTML file and copy the provided code into it.
Save the HTML file with a .html extension.
Save the CSS styles in a separate file named styles.css in the same directory as the HTML file.
Make sure to provide the correct URLs for the image sources in the src attributes of the <img> tags.


Structure
The HTML code is structured as follows:
The <head> section includes the necessary meta tags for character encoding and viewport settings.
The <title> element sets the title of the page to "Photo Gallery."
The <link> tag references an external CSS file named styles.css for styling the photo gallery.
The <body> section contains a header with the class "header" and a <div> element with the class "gallery."
The header includes an <h1> element that displays the heading "css flexbox photo gallery."
The gallery contains multiple <img> tags, each with a src attribute pointing to a different image URL.
  

Styling
The styling for the photo gallery is defined in the styles.css file. Make sure to customize the styles in this file to achieve the desired appearance of the photo gallery. You can modify the layout, sizing, spacing, and any other visual aspects using CSS rules.


Customization
To customize the photo gallery, you can:
Add or remove images by modifying the <img> tags within the gallery <div>.
Adjust the styles in the styles.css file to change the layout, spacing, or any other visual properties.
Modify the text in the header by editing the content within the <h1> element.


Compatibility
The code utilizes modern HTML and CSS features and should work in most modern web browsers. However, it's always a good practice to test your code in different browsers and devices to ensure proper compatibility.
